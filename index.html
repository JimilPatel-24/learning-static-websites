        <h1>Hi! , I am Jimil Patel</h2>
        <p> Welcome to my journey as a game dev so far.</p>
        <h2>How it all Started...</h2>
        <p>My journey began when I stumbled across Brackeys’ famous “How to Make a Game” video. Completing that first tutorial filled me with excitement and motivation. From there, I began experimenting with different mechanics, building small projects ranging from top-down shooters to a lava-based adventure game. </p>
        In Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2, I created my first jam entry. Out of 1,698 entries, my game ranked #858. For me, this was an incredible milestone — my first step into the global game dev community.

After experimenting with Unity, I explored Blender to improve the visuals of my projects. While I realized 3D modeling wasn’t my strongest fit, I still dedicated time to learning and creating renders. Some of my work is showcased here, reflecting the effort I put into improving the look and feel of my games.

        <h3>The Production Quality</h3>
        <p>
           After gaining experience with tutorials, prototypes, and jams, I set out to bring my own idea to life. The result was Balance!!!, my first original game — designed, developed, and published entirely by me. Publishing this game taught me not only game design and programming, but also production, polish, and publishing skills. After navigating Google Play’s publishing process, I successfully shipped the game to the world, where it was downloaded and enjoyed by 42 players organically.
